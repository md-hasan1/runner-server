# Runner — Backend (styled entry)

Runner — GitHub: https://github.com/md-hasan1/runner-server

Worked in a team to build the backend for a courier/delivery platform providing parcel lifecycle management, driver matching, payments and invoicing, and push notifications.

Features (concise):
- Parcel lifecycle & driver matching (transactional creation + tracking).
- Stripe payments & pay‑later invoicing (PDF + email automation).
- Firebase push notifications (FCM) with persisted history.
- Secure file uploads (profiles, proof-of-delivery) & admin/merchant APIs.

Demo credentials: Not found in code (no public demo credentials included in repository).

Technology: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Prisma (Postgres), Stripe, Firebase Admin (FCM), Nodemailer + PDFKit, Multer, Cloudinary / DigitalOcean Spaces, Zod, JWT.

Notes: This repository is server-side only (backend). Frontend/client was not part of this repo (Not found in code).
